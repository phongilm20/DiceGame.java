# Running Total Calculator (Java)

This is a simple Java console application that calculates a running total of numbers entered by the user. This project was created to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts, specifically the use of loops (`while`) and conditional statements (`if`). It serves as a practical exercise for beginners learning core Java syntax.

## Features

- Prompts the user to enter numbers repeatedly.
- Maintains a running sum of all numbers entered.
- Automatically stops accepting input once the total reaches or exceeds 100.
- Reports the count of numbers the user entered *before* the final number that pushed the sum over 100.
- Calculates and displays by how much the final sum exceeded the 100-point threshold.

## Technical Concepts Demonstrated

- **Loops:** Utilizes a `while` loop to continuously accept user input until a specific condition (total >= 100) is met.
- **Conditional Statements:** Uses `if` statements to control program flow and check the final state of the total.
- **User Input:** Implements the `java.util.Scanner` class to read input from the console.
- **Variable Management:** Tracks multiple pieces of data simultaneously (the running total, the count of numbers, etc.).

## How to Run

You need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

1.  **Compile the code:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the file is saved, and run the following command:
    ```bash
    javac YourFileName.java
    ```
    *(Replace `YourFileName.java` with the actual name of your Java file.)*

2.  **Run the program:** After successful compilation, run the program with this command:
    ```bash
    java YourFileName
    ```
